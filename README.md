# Topological-Phases-and-Quantum-Computation
Here contains the notes I compiled on the topic of topological phases, in particular about studies of topological order in (2+1)-dimension and anyons. My main references are the work of Kitaev in “Topological phases and quantum computation” (arXiv:0904.2771v1) and “Anyons in an exactly solved model and beyond” (arXiv:cond-mat/0506438v3).
